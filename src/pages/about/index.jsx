        <h2>Our history</h2>
        <p>
          Plantme was formed with the idea to help people pause and breathe in
          some peace in their busy city lives. When Siddhant returned back to
          India after finishing his degree in Landscape Architecture at Cal
          Tech, he noticed the disconnect between people and nature and decided
          to start Plantme to build a bridge between the two.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rooted firmly in his familyâ€™s century old agri-tech business, Plantme
          sprung up like a new leaf on a spring morning and is today a mighty
          tree that helps other smaller businesses thrive in its shade. We have
          formed a proudly Made in India ecosystem that grows with each passing
          day.
